# Lyrics scraper
A script to scrape song lyrics for a particular artist. I needed this to gather lyrics data for a larger project, and hopefully it can be useful for you too. To use:
* Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup) if you don't already have them
* Open data/lyrics_scraper.py
* Set ARTIST_URL to point to the "Artist page" on the supported website
* Run script
